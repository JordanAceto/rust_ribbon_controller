# Rust Language STM32L412 Ribbon Controller

## Three analog outputs
- Ribbon: 1volt/per octave scaled control voltage generated by the main ribbon
- Gate: 5 volt gate signal which is high when pressing the main ribbon and low otherwise
- Mod: mod-wheel like control voltage generated by the MOD ribbon, in `[0v, +5v]` 

## MIDI output
- Note on/off based on finger position on the ribbon
- Pitch-bend message bends the pitch when the ribbon is in between notes 
- Mod: mod-wheel message generated by the MOD ribbon

## Project goals
- Mostly just for fun and to explore embedded Rust
- Serve as a test bed for the [Josh Ox Ribbon Synth](https://github.com/JordanAceto/josh_Ox_ribbon_synth)
- Build a cute little CV and MIDI source

## Simplified signal flow
- Finger position along the ribbon is digitized by the onboard `ADC`
- This position is fed into the `ribbon_controller` software module which conditions the signal and extracts a note on/off gate information
- The smooth output of the `ribbon_controller` is fed into a quantizer to force it to discrete musical half steps, depending on the pitch mode
- MIDI data is sent as note on/off and pitch bend messages
- Analog pitch, mod, and gate signals are sent via the DAC and GPIO pins

## Three pitch modes are available
1) Hard quantize mode: notes are forced to be musical half steps, sliding around will zipper to new notes
2) Assist mode: when you first press a new note it is forced to be a musical half step, but continued sliding is smooth
3) Smooth mode: no quantization is performed, offers the greatest degree of pitch freedom but is difficult to play in tune

## Important note for the MIDI output
- This software assumes that the pitch bend range on the recieving instrument is set to +/- 2 semitones (this is typically the default)
- If the Assist or Smooth modes seem crazy, make sure that the pitch bend range on your instrument is set correctly

## Project status
- Boards for the main pcb and faceplate have been manufactured and tested
- The jack panel is not complete
- A wooden housing is planned, but not started
